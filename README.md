# Thesis_Circus_Lyfe
This repository contains the source code and APK for Circus Lyfe.

Circus Lyfe is a narrative life simulation game for Android devices, created for my senior undergraduate thesis at New College of Florida. 

Circus Lyfe was written in Unity 2019.3.3f1, using a modified version of Yarn Spinner version 1.1. 

To download the game, you need either an Android device or emulated Android device running Android version 4.4 or higher. 
First, you will need to give permission to install apps from unknown sources. This process differs from device to device, but for Android versions 8.8 and up the general process is:
-Open Settings
-Tap on Apps
-Tap on Special App Access
-Tap on Install Unknown Apps
-Give permission to Chrome (or whatever web browser you are using) by tapping the icon and "Allow from this source."

*If you have a copy of this repository and the APK downloaded to the desktop, you can skip the above steps. 
-Connect your Android device to the computer by USB cable and on the phone select the option to give the computer permission to transfer files. 
-Transfer the APK onto the Android device, navigate to it with the Android device's file manager, and follow the following steps.
-Continue to the next steps.

Then, navigate to this repository in your device's web browser and download "Circus_Lyfe.apk." Once it is downloaded, tap on the APK on your notifications or navigate to it in your file manager and tap on it. 
You will be asked if you would like to install the app, click "install." After the install finishes you will be able to play the game.
